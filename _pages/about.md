I'm Youngseok Kim, a PhD candidate in the Graduate School of Green Transportation (GSGT) at KAIST under [Prof. Dongsuk Kum](http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/). 

My research interest lies in computer vision and machine learning for autonomous driving system. My current focus is on the robust and cost-effective 3D object detection system using off-the-shelf monocular camera and radar.
